## Student Score Prediction

The Student Score Prediction project uses various regression models to predict student scores. The best-performing model is deployed as a Flask web application on [Render](https://mlproject-hw1j.onrender.com/predictdata), for on-demand predictions with new data. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) reveals that Student's Performance is related to lunch, race, and parental level of education; females have a higher pass percentage and are top scorers; Student's Performance has a limited correlation with test preparation course completion, though completing the preparation course is generally beneficial.
